# btrfs-rollback

Btrfs rollback tool written in Go for Arch-based distributions.

> [!WARNING]
> This tool is designed to be used in a live environment, such as a live USB or a booted snapshot. **Do not use this tool on your primary system without understanding the consequences.** Running it on the wrong system or environment may result in critical data loss or system instability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

By default, the config file is located at `/etc/btrfs-rollback.toml`:

```toml
# Name of your root subvolume (usually "@")
subvol_main = "@"

# Name of the subvolume where snapshots are stored
subvol_snapshots = "@snapshots"

# Temporary directory where the Btrfs root will be mounted
mountpoint = "/btrfs"

# Path to the Btrfs device. Required only if auto-mounting is needed
dev = "/dev/sda2"
```

Make sure to adjust the configuration to reflect your system's Btrfs setup and the live environment you are working in.
